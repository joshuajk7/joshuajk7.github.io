      <h2>Description</h2>
      
        <h3>üéµ CNN Genre Classifier: Deep Learning for Music Genre Recognition></h3>
        <p>This project is a deep learning-based music genre classification system that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify the genre of audio tracks using MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features. Designed for scalability and efficiency, the system is built in Python using TensorFlow/Keras, and supports training on large datasets without exhausting system memory.</p>
        
       <h3>üîç Project Overview</h3>
        <p>At its core, the system processes a large collection of JSON files‚Äîeach containing MFCC features and corresponding genre labels extracted from music samples. These features serve as a time-frequency representation of audio, making them ideal input for CNNs to learn genre-specific patterns.</p>
        
        <h3>‚öôÔ∏è Key Features</h3>
        <p>Efficient Data Handling: Utilizes a custom MFCCDataGenerator that inherits from tf.keras.utils.Sequence to load and preprocess data in batches during training. This enables training on datasets that would otherwise be too large to fit into memory.</p>
        
        <p>Dynamic Batch Size Estimation: Automatically estimates a safe and optimal batch size based on available system memory using the psutil library, ensuring stability and performance even on low-resource machines.</p>
        
        <p>CNN Architecture: The model consists of stacked convolutional, max pooling, batch normalization, and dropout layers, followed by fully connected dense layers. This architecture is tailored for image-like MFCC data and is effective at capturing hierarchical audio features.</p>
        
        <p>Balanced Training: Implements automatic class weight calculation to counteract imbalanced genre distributions, improving model fairness and generalization.</p>
        
        <p>Modular and Scalable Design: Cleanly separated functions for model building, data loading, training, and evaluation make the project easy to understand, extend, and deploy.</p>
        
        <h3>üìÅ Input Format</h3>
        <p>Directory of .json files, where each file contains:</p>
        
        <p>"mfcc": A list of MFCC samples (e.g., 130 frames √ó 13 coefficients)</p>
        
        <p>"labels": Corresponding integer labels</p>
        
        <p>"mapping": A list mapping class indices to genre names</p>
        
        <h3>üß† Output</h3>
        <p>A trained Keras model saved as an .h5 file (cnn_genre_classifier_v1.2.h5)</p>
        
        <p>Console logs reporting training progress, batch size, and evaluation metrics</p>
        
        <h3>üíª Applications</h3>

        <p>Music recommendation systems</p>
